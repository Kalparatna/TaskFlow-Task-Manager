# 🚀 Deployment Checklist

## Frontend Environment Variables Required

### For Vercel Dashboard
Set these environment variables in your Vercel project settings:

1. **VITE_API_URL** 
   - Development: `http://localhost:8000/api`
   - Production: `https://your-backend-api.com/api`

## Files Created/Updated for Deployment

✅ `Client/.env` - Local development environment variables
✅ `Client/.env.example` - Template for environment variables  
✅ `Client/.env.production` - Production environment reference
✅ `vercel.json` - Vercel deployment configuration
✅ `.vercelignore` - Files to exclude from deployment

## Current Status

- ✅ Frontend configured for deployment
- ⚠️ Backend API URL needs to be updated when backend is deployed
- ✅ Environment variables documented
- ✅ Vercel configuration optimized for frontend-only deployment

## Next Steps

1. Deploy frontend to Vercel
2. Deploy backend to your preferred platform (Railway, Heroku, etc.)
3. Update `VITE_API_URL` in Vercel environment variables
4. Test the deployed application

## Environment Variable Setup in Vercel

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings → Environment Variables
3. Add `VITE_API_URL` with your backend URL
